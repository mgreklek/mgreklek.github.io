											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p> Hello, welcome to my webpage! <br /> <br />

											I am a PhD Candidate in Planetary Sciences at Caltech. 
											I work on the observational characterization of exoplanets with Professor <a href="https://www.heatherknutson.org/">Heather Knutson</a>.
											My research interests include exoplanet detection, interior and atmospheric characterization, dynamics and tides, and host star radiation/activity. 
											In my PhD thesis work, I have used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit-timing_variation#:~:text=Transit%2Dtiming%20variation%20is%20a,small%20as%20that%20of%20Earth.">transit timing variations</a> 
											and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_spectroscopy">radial velocity observations</a> to measure planetary radii, masses, orbital eccentricities, 
											and tidal heat fluxes, and characterized the XUV flux of planet host stars. I hope to understand the true diversity of
											compositions for small planets, and investigate their formation, evolution, and habitability. 
											I work on this by combining observations with statistical analysis and dynamical modeling.
											<br /> <br />

											Previously, I worked as a <a href="https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/674/swx_services/swx_services_list.html">space weather forecaster</a> at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, 
											where I monitored real-time solar wind conditions and eruptions to make predictions for 
											impacts to NASA assets throughout the solar system. This work was exciting and fulfilling, 
											especially when there were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_mass_ejection">coronal mass ejections</a> headed straight for the Earth! <br /> <br />
											
											I received dual BS degrees in Physics and Astronomy with a minor in Planetary Science from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2019. 
											I originally focused on plasma physics and heliophysics research, before switching to exoplanets. 
											I worked with Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9OD-280AAAAJ&hl=en">Drake Deming</a> for my undergraduate thesis on identifying false positive planet candidates from the K2 Mission. 
											Despite several later additions, this work keeps my standing count of planets discovered at -2. <br />

										<h3>Tidally Heated Sub-Neptunes in the TOI-1266 System</h3>
										<p> 
											I used extensive ground- and space-based transit follow-up combined with archival radial velocity 
											observations of the TOI-1266 system to confirm the existence of a new exterior planet,
											and to measure the planetary eccentricities and tidal heat fluxes.
											I found that TOI-1266 b has a tidal heat flux > 100 times the volcanically active Jovian moon Io, 
											which may be responsible for puffing up its radius compared to its outer neighbor TOI-1266 c. 
											This work also identifies TOI-1266 c as a likely water-rich planet.

										<h3>Constraints on Planet Formation from TTVs in the Kepler-289 System</h3>
										<p> I used transit timing variations to improve the mass measurements for the three planets in the Kepler-289 system,
											which contains two inner rocky planets and an outer gas giant near the 1:2:4 Laplace <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_resonance ">orbital resonance</a>.
											By measuring the masses of the inner two rocky planets, we can place a lower limit on the amount
											of solid material delivered to the inner protoplanetary disk. This constrains the formation location of the outer gas giant 
											planet much further out than its current location, indicative of planetary migration.

										<h3>Invalidating Planet Candidates from K2</h3>
										<p> In my undergraduate thesis work, I inspected transit photometry from the K2 mission and identified several planet candidates 
											that exhibited secondary eclipses. Calculating the implied brightness temperature of these objects
											from their secondary eclipse depths revealed that they are too hot to be planets, and are instead consistent
											with blended eclipsing binary stars.

										<h3>A Survey of Bulk Compositions for Small Planets around M Stars</h3>
										<p> I am conducting a survey of small planets (< 3 Earth radii) in multi-planet systems
											around M stars, using transit timing variations and radial velocity observations
											to better constrain the planetary bulk densities and compositions.
											Improved mass and radius measurements allow us to 
											better understand the formation and evolution of these terrestrial exoplanets, 
											and identify top candidates for atmospheric characterization. Stay tuned for future papers on more systems coming soon!</p>

										<h3>Characterizing the Radiation Environments of Rocky Planets</h3>
										<p>I am the PI of two ongoing XMM-Newton space telescope programs to observe
											the X-ray and far ultraviolet flux of nearby M dwarf stars. These stars each host multiple 
											small planets spanning the radius valley from rocky super-Earths to volatile-rich
											mini-Neptunes, allowing us to assess the comparative impact of stellar irradiation on exoplanet atmospheres.

										<h3>Mapping the Earth's Magnetosphere with Relativistic Electron Beams</h3>
										<p> How does the Earth's magnetic field respond to changes in solar wind conditions? 
											How quickly does it bounce back after being hit by a coronal mass ejection? 
											These questions can be answered by precisely tracking the Earth's magnetic field lines under 
											changing conditions, and one way to do that is by launching charged particles at Earth from an orbiting 
											satellite to create localized aurora that can be tracked from the ground. I modeled how this process works at the 
											Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. If you are a billionaire interested in creating your own personalized 
											aurora (during quiet solar wind conditions), please get in touch!!

										<p>I greatly enjoy contributing to and participating in accessible, inclusive, sustainable community outreach programs. 
											Through Caltech's <a href="https://go-outdoors.caltech.edu/">GO-Outdoors program</a>, I've developed interactive lesson plans for space science topics 
											in the Next Generation Science Standards and implemented them for several middle school classes, and volunteered 
											in other teacher-requested activities which have brought GO-Outdoors to 1000+ public school students in 
											just the first few years of the program! I've also given <a href="https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/visitor/visitorcenter/talks/">public outreach talks</a> at Palomar Observatory and
											volunteered with Skype-A-Scientist.</p>
